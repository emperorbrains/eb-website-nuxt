                  We came such a long way and so much has happened in the past
                  two decades. We built things, met so many people, created life
                  long friendships, learned so much and grew as a whole. Looking
                  back, it was a bumpy ride. Sometimes the days and months
                  seemed endless and hopeless too. But the beautiful destination
                  is worth the struggle of the journey! And what a journey it
                  turned out to be!

                  Our definition of success changed a long time ago. Making a
                  difference in a few lives is a worthy goal, but helping people
                  to achieve the things they want to achieve is really what we
                  want to be remembered for.
